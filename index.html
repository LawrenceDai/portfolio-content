			About the game
		</h1>
		<p>
			Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a 2012 multiplayer first-person shooter developed by Valve and Hidden Path Entertainment. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series. Counter-Strike Global Offensive was released for Windows, macOS, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 in August 2012, and for Linux in 2014. Global Offensive received positive reviews from critics on release, who praised the game for its gameplay and faithfulness to the Counter-Strike series. Since its release, it has drawn in an estimated 11 million players per month and remains one of the most played games on Valve's Steam platform. The game has an active esports scene, continuing the history of international competitive play from previous games in the series. Teams compete in professional leagues and tournaments, and Global Offensive is now one of the largest global esports. It has been awarded "Best eSports Game" at The Game Awards 2017, The Game Awards 2019 and The Game Awards 2020 shows.

			General Game Play
		</h1>
		<p>
			The game is played between two teams that will compete against each other in a round-based game. At the start of the game, the players may join either the Counter-Terrorist side or the Terrorist side and play in that team for the duration of the first half of the game. A team wins the game when their score exceeds a set amount. A point is scored whenever a team eliminates the opposing team completely or completes their team-specific objective. When the game reaches halftime, the sides will swap; the Counter-Terrorist team will now play as Terrorists and vice versa. The game continues in the second half until one team wins or the game ties (where the game ends with both sides having the same score).
